# KitchenSink

Shows how to model different UI patterns in JSON:

- Rendering (Breadcrumb, Chart, Datagrid, HTML, Link, Map, Markdown, Pagination, Table)
- Server Push (Async Response, Cookies, Dialog Box, Flash Message, Lazy Loading, Nested Views, Progress Bar, Redirect, Client Local State)
- User Input (Autocomplete, Button, Checkbox, Datepicker, Dropdown, Decimal Input, File Upload, Integer Input, Multiselect, Password, Radio Button, Radiolist, Text Input, Textarea, Toggle Button, Validation)

## Requirements

This repository uses features from C# 7. Thus, **Visual Studio 2017** is required to build. 

If you really want to use VS 2015 and you don't care about IntelliSense warnings, you can build by installing [Microsoft.Net.Compilers](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Net.Compilers/) in the project using NuGet (`Install-Package Microsoft.Net.Compilers`). That will make VS use the C# compiler provided in the package instead of the default one.
